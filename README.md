# Analyzing-the-Impact-of-Car-Features-on-Price-and-Profitability
### Problem Statement:
The automotive industry has been rapidly evolving over the past few decades, with a
growing focus on fuel efficiency, environmental sustainability, and technological innovation.
With increasing competition among manufacturers and a changing consumer landscape, it
has become more important than ever to understand the factors that drive consumer
demand for cars.
In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards electric and hybrid vehicles and
increased interest in alternative fuel sources such as hydrogen and natural gas. At the same
time, traditional gasoline-powered cars remain dominant in the market, with varying fuel
types and grades available to consumers.
For the given dataset, as a Data Analyst, the client has asked How can a car manufacturer
optimize pricing and product development decisions to maximize profitability while meeting
consumer demand?
This problem could be approached by analyzing the relationship between a car&#39;s features,
market category, and pricing, and identifying which features and categories are most popular
among consumers and most profitable for the manufacturer. By using data analysis
techniques such as regression analysis and market segmentation, the manufacturer could
develop a pricing strategy that balances consumer demand with profitability, and identify
which product features to focus on in future product development efforts. This could help the
manufacturer improve its competitiveness

### Tasks: Analysis
Before diving into the analysis of the given dataset, it is important to perform thorough data
cleaning to ensure accurate and reliable results. You need to build an interactive dashboard
in Excel from the tasks given below:
Insight Required: How does the popularity of a car model vary across different market
categories?

● Task 1.A: Create a pivot table that shows the number of car models in each market
category and their corresponding popularity scores.

● Task 1.B: Create a combo chart that visualizes the relationship between market
category and popularity.
Insight Required: What is the relationship between a car&#39;s engine power and its price?

● Task 2: Create a scatter chart that plots engine power on the x-axis and price on the
y-axis. Add a trendline to the chart to visualize the relationship between these
variables.
Insight Required: Which car features are most important in determining a car&#39;s price?

● Task 3: Use regression analysis to identify the variables that have the strongest
relationship with a car&#39;s price. Then create a bar chart that shows the coefficient
values for each variable to visualize their relative importance.
Insight Required: How does the average price of a car vary across different manufacturers?

● Task 4.A: Create a pivot table that shows the average price of cars for each
manufacturer.

● Task 4.B: Create a bar chart or a horizontal stacked bar chart that visualizes the
relationship between manufacturer and average price.
Insight Required: What is the relationship between fuel efficiency and the number of
cylinders in a car&#39;s engine?

● Task 5.A: Create a scatter plot with the number of cylinders on the x-axis and
highway MPG on the y-axis. Then create a trendline on the scatter plot to visually
estimate the slope of the relationship and assess its significance.

● Task 5.B: Calculate the correlation coefficient between the number of cylinders and
highway MPG to quantify the strength and direction of the relationship.

### Building the Dashboard:
Now for the Next portion of the Project, you need to create the Interactive Dashboard.
Use filters and slicers to make the chart interactive. The client has requested these
questions given below:
● Task 1: How does the distribution of car prices vary by brand and body style?

● Task 2: Which car brands have the highest and lowest average MSRPs, and how does this
vary by body style?

● Task 3: How do the different feature such as transmission type affect the MSRP, and how
does this vary by body style?

● Task 4: How does the fuel efficiency of cars vary across different body styles and model
years?

● Task 5: How does the car&#39;s horsepower, MPG, and price vary across different Brands?
